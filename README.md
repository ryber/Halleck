Halleck is a "micro-learning management system" (or LMS) aimed at small teams and organizations that want to track learning activities. It aims at being fast and minimal, without the bloat of traditional LMS's.

Halleck is of course named after Gurney Halleck; Paul Atreides weapons trainer from Frank Herbert's 'Dune'
